Last updated 2026-11-08 (overnight aging-network push). Network plan: Desktop\02 AGING SAFELY BATHS\07 Aging Safely Website Network\MASTER GAMEPLAN.md. Rules: C:\Users\zachw\aging-sweep\notes\RULES.md.

## Lane
California: metros, Medi-Cal/CalAIM home modifications, CSLB contractor rules.

Every page here supports agingsafelybaths.com (quotes, installs) and never targets its head terms (walk in tubs, walk in tub cost, handicap showers, roll in showers, Medicaid/grants head terms). Max 2 followed network links per page; other network links nofollow; one nofollow Eye To Ad credit.

## Business facts
Aging Safely Baths & More, LLC. 1-888-779-2284, sales@agingsafelybaths.com. BBB A+ since 2012. Published prices only (RULES.md): walk-in tub about $15,500 installed after the $2,000 promo, $15,250 veterans, roll-in showers $13,500 to $17,000, wide/transfer/bariatric from about $19,000.

## Targets (one page owns one term)
- walk in tubs california
- walk in tub los angeles / san diego / bay area
- medi-cal home modifications

## Competitors (live check 2026-11-08; search results, not verified rank)
- homeadvisor.com city listings dominate: no prices, no CSLB guidance
- ReBath / American Standard provider pages

**How we beat them:** License check, the 10%/$1,000 deposit rule, Medi-Cal steps by plan.

## Done tonight (2026-11-08)
- Quote forms now post to the company lead server (clients.eyetoad.com/lead/send.php, saves to disk first, then emails sales) through /lead-send.js, with the old sender (FormSubmit or EmailJS) as automatic fallback. Pilot verified in a live browser on walkintubsflorida.com.
- GA4 tag (property per site, events generate_lead, phone_click, estimator_use) confirmed on every indexable page; Search Console verification file googleadb17462a109b3ca.html present.
- Lighthouse (home page, live, 2026-11-08 early morning) recorded before and after in _overnight-reports/aging-sites-report.md.
- New /privacy/ page with footer link on all 28 pages.
- Contrast fixes (kickers, footer small text), underlined in-text links.

## Next
1. Medi-Cal asset limit 2026 and bathroom modifications (DHCS letter 25-14)
1. Community Supports request steps by plan (Molina referral form and others)
1. Contract deposit and cancellation rules (CSLB seniors guide; verify B&P 7159)

## Morning to-dos (network)
- Add the six EmailJS satellites (seniorwalkintub, utahwalkintubs, walkintubdenver, walkintubscalifornia, walkintubschicago, walkintubstexas) to lead-config.php on clients.eyetoad.com so they stop falling back to EmailJS.
- Confirm where aging-site leads from the lead server are emailed (sales@agingsafelybaths.com?) and that the mail lands; fix eyetoad.com SPF/DMARC.
- Request indexing in Search Console for every new or changed URL listed in the report.
- AdSense: not added to these lead-gen pages on purpose (ads next to a quote form cost leads). Decide if any info-only page should carry it.

## Measurement
GA4 property per site (account 45765285), key events generate_lead and phone_click. Search Console: bare domain property, sitemap.xml submitted. Check queries and positions in GA4's Search Console report at the start of every project.
